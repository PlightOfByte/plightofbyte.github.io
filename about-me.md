Hi, my name is Sumit Gupta. I'm a **software/application/web developer**, from [Gurgaon, India](http://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Gurugram).  
I'm in this business because I love technology and it never fails to fascinate me.
I've been working for more than 6 years, during this time I've learned a lot.
Don't they say if you have knowledge, let others light their candles in it.

When it's compiling, I read articles, lots of them or listening to music.

Below are my social feeds if you want to reach me.
